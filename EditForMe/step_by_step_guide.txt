Step-by-Step Guide to Execute the AI Agent

1. Install Required Libraries :
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Get Gemini API Key
Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

Copy your API key

3. Run the Chat Agent
From the folder where main.py is located, run:
python main.py --api_key=YOUR_API_KEY --chat
python main.py --api_key=AIzaSyDWU96YGaNJWcsuRx9tcwHGTbAHTGv4UFc --chat
Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual Gemini API key.

4. Use the Agent Interactively
▶️ Start a new game:
💬 Your input: new

🧠 Describe your 2D game idea: a top-down arcade with collectibles
Avoid using words that can be flagged by the AI like: Kill, death, Gun, etc

→ The agent will show the code and ask:
💬 Do you want to write this code to file? (yes/no):
🔁 Modify the game:

💬 Your input: Add player health and enemies

→ Again, it previews the modified code and asks for confirmation.

❌ Exit:
💬 Your input: exit

5. Resulting File
After confirmation, the generated/modified code will be saved as:
generated_game.py

You can open and run this in VS Code, PyCharm, or from terminal.

6. Optional: Run the Game
If the generated game uses Pygame or similar libraries:

pip install pygame
python generated_game.py
